### Labs

Two Labs were performed: F-MINST and Climate, which were also made available on the colab at:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iGfkeEbDQKaU7tmDigS_kR2O6P-SmPKQ?usp=sharing
Lab changes were stored in the nvidia_bootcamp/labs folder.
- In Lab F-MINST the numbers of neurons and layers were varied. Then, a 2d convolutional network was used, which improved the accuracy from 0.78 to 0.90
- Lab Climate was not fully executed. Also available at

### Hackathon
- The Hackaton Lab was based on the improvement of a UNET network for CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) prediction. It was run on NVIDIA's JupyterLab (Competition.ipynb) and the changes were stored in the nvidia/hackaton folder.
- The code is also available at https://github.com/openhackathons-org/gpubootcamp/tree/master/hpc_ai , where it is noted that it is possible to use containers as well.
